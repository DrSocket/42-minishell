# minishell

## Objective
Write a unix shell using C.

The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT.
At the time, all developers agreed that communicating with a computer using aligned
1/0 switches was seriously irritating.
It was only logical that they came up with the idea of creating a software to communicate with a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat
close to the human language.
Thanks to Minishell, you’ll be able to travel through time and come back to problems
people faced when Windows didn’t exist.
